# Save files

The save files are a list of values separated by newline.

There are two save files, `file0` and `file9`. When you save your game, both get written to the same values.
It is unknown why there are two save files instead of one. `file9` seem to be written to when you load a save file.
Only `file0` is required to load a game. `file9` might be used as a backup, or when Flowey breaks your main save game.
